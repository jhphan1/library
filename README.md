# library
This app allows the user to compile and manage a reading list. The user is able to add/delete books, store title/author info, and track whether they have read the books.

This project was an introduction to objects, object constructors, and prototypes. Personally, I found the concept of objects and constructors straightforward; therefore, they were easy to implement right away. The concept of prototypes (and adding functions to objects through prototypes) was more abstract, requiring more research and practice. I also learned about the useful data-attribute which is great for storing info in HTML elements without being visible on the webpage.
